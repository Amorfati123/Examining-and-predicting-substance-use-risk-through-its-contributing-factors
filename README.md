# Examining-and-predicting-substance-use-risk-through-its-contributing-factors
This project seeks to examine which factors contribute to substance use and substance use frequency. This work aims to identify populations that are more vulnerable to substance use and substance use frequency to assist in creating data-based interventions. Using data analysis, we identify which populations are most vulnerable to using different substances. Our hope is to provide information for public health entities to direct interventions toward those populations that need it the most.
